CVE-2018-0387¨A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Teams (for Windows and macOS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's device, possibly with elevated privileges. The vulnerability occurs because Cisco Webex Teams does not properly sanitize input. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a user a malicious link and persuading the user to follow the link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system.

CVE-2018-0422¨A vulnerability in the folder permissions of Cisco Webex Meetings client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to modify locally stored files and execute code on a targeted device with the privilege level of the user. The vulnerability is due to folder permissions that grant a user the permission to read, write, and execute files in the Webex folders. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to write malicious files to the Webex client directory, affecting all other users of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow a user to execute commands with elevated privileges. Attacks on single-user systems are less likely to occur, as the attack must be carried out by the user on the user's own system. Multiuser systems have a higher risk of exploitation because folder permissions have an impact on all users of the device. For an attacker to exploit this vulnerability successfully, a second user must execute the locally installed malicious file to allow remote code execution to occur.¨27.11.2017¨05.09.2018¨282¨E¨Cisco Webex¨6.9¨6¨MEDIUM¨1.0¨10.0¨3.4¨Local¨0.0¨Medium¨1.0¨¨2.0¨Complete¨2.0¨Complete¨2.0¨Complete¨2.0¨vulner folder permiss cisco webex meet client window could allow authent local attack modifi local store file execut code target devic privileg level user vulner due folder permiss grant user permiss read write execut file webex folder attack could exploit vulner write malici file webex client directori affect user target devic success exploit could allow user execut command elev privileg attack singl user system less like occur attack must carri user user system multius system higher risk exploit folder permiss impact user devic attack exploit vulner success second user must execut local instal malici file allow remot code execut occur¨vulner folder permiss cisco webex meet client window could allow authent local attack modifi local store file execut code target devic privileg level user vulner due folder permiss grant user permiss read write execut file webex folder attack could exploit vulner write malici file webex client directori affect user target devic success exploit could allow user execut command elev privileg attack singl user system less like occur attack must carri user user system multius system higher risk exploit folder permiss impact user devic attack exploit vulner success second user must execut local instal malici file allow remot code execut occur

CVE-2021-28133¨Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.¨10.03.2021¨26.03.2021¨16¨A¨Zoom¨4.3¨4¨MEDIUM¨1.0¨2.9¨8.6¨Network¨2.0¨Medium¨1.0¨¨2.0¨Partial¨1.0¨¨0.0¨¨0.0¨zoom sometim allow attack read privat inform particip screen even though particip never attempt share privat part screen user share specif applic window via share screen function meet particip briefli see content applic window explicitli share content window instanc seen short period time overlay share window get focu attack cours use separ screen record applic unsupport zoom save content later replay analysi depend unintent share data short exposur screen content may less sever secur issu¨zoom sometim allow attack read privat inform particip screen even though particip never attempt share privat part screen user share specif applic window via share screen function meet particip briefli see content applic window explicitli share content window instanc seen short period time overlay share window get focu attack cours use separ screen record applic unsupport zoom save content later replay analysi depend unintent share data short exposur screen content may less sever secur issu
